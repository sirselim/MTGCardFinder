# MTG Card Markdown Toolkit

## Overview

The MTG Card Markdown Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code simplifies the process of working with Magic: The Gathering (MTG) card names in Markdown documents. It provides two main features:

1. Convert Card Name: Allows users to select text containing MTG card names and convert them into Markdown links. This is particularly useful for quickly creating links to the Scryfall pages for specific cards.
2. Convert Card Table: Enables users to select a list of Markdown-formatted card links and converts them into a table format with three columns. This is helpful for organizing and presenting multiple card links in a structured table within a Markdown document.

## Key Features

- Convert individual MTG card names to Markdown links.
- Create a Markdown table from selected card names for better organization and presentation.

## Usage
